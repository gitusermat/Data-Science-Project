This project involves developing machine learning models to predict Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for Quality of Experience (QoE) analysis in telecommunication data. Key tasks include data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, and encoding categorical variables), addressing class imbalance using SMOTE, and implementing Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers. Performance metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices were used to evaluate the models, with feature importance analysis providing insights into the key drivers of predictions.
